# 🧧 Chinese Fortune Teller - Brownian Motion Oracle

A fun interactive fortune teller that uses mathematical Brownian motion to determine your luck! Watch as a particle starts at position 5 and randomly walks until it reaches either boundary - your fate depends on where it lands.

## 🎋 How It Works

- **Starting Position**: 5 (balanced between fortune and misfortune)
- **Lucky Boundary**: 10 (brings good fortune and positive predictions)
- **Unlucky Boundary**: 0 (brings challenging times and warnings)
- **Movement**: Random walk simulation using Brownian motion principles

## 🏮 Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch the particle's journey in real-time
- **Chinese Aesthetic**: Traditional red and gold color scheme with cultural elements
- **Dynamic Fortunes**: Hundreds of authentic Chinese-inspired fortunes
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and JavaScript animations
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: Proper Brownian motion simulation

## 🎯 Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click "Seek Your Fortune" to begin
3. Watch the particle's random walk
4. Receive your fortune when it reaches a boundary
5. Click "Try Again" for a new reading

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Pure JavaScript**: No external dependencies
- **Canvas Animation**: Smooth particle visualization
- **Mathematical Model**: Discrete Brownian motion with absorbing boundaries
- **Cultural Design**: Inspired by traditional Chinese fortune telling

## 🎊 Sample Fortunes

**Good Fortune (Boundary 10):**
- "A golden dragon brings prosperity to your path"
- "Like bamboo, you will bend but never break"
- "The phoenix rises - transformation brings success"

**Challenging Times (Boundary 0):**
- "Storm clouds gather, but remember - rain nourishes growth"
- "The wise turtle knows when to retreat into its shell"
- "Every winter is followed by spring's renewal"

## 🧮 Mathematics

The simulation uses a discrete random walk where each step moves ±0.1 with equal probability. This approximates continuous Brownian motion while ensuring the visualization is smooth and engaging.
